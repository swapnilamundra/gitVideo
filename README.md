<br>#This is the Readme.md file#</br>

This file is to give a brief overview of what the repo is about.
I have created so many repos in the past but this one will always be special. Thanks to the tutor/youtuber Nick White.
He made it so simple that I didn't find Git and Github so overwhelming
I think it was a necessary step to learn fundamentals first but he teacher like a 5yold which is so important.

I am going to put some basic commands that he taught which I think are quintessential in learning GIT.

He taught 

1) Made me download GITSCM as it wasn't on my computer
2) Create a Repo on machine                                                      ||  mkdir gitVideo
3) Use command line using MinTTY
4) Create files to the repo using touch command                                  ||  touch index.html demo.py or touch <filename> for single
5) Initialize the repo with GIT                                                  ||  git init
6) Add files to git using                                                        ||  for all files git add. or single file git add <filename>         
7) Commit those changes                                                          ||  git commit -m 'message'
8) Make changes by deleting and adding new files and re-commiting those changes  ||  rm index.html | commit -m 'removed html file'
9) Config work with email and name                                               ||  git config --global user.email"swapnilamundra1811@gmail.com"  | git config --global user.name"Swapnila Mundra"
10) Put the folder created on to GitHub                                          ||  git remote add origin https://github.com/swapnilamundra/gitVideo.git
11) Push to the website                                                          ||  git push -u origin master
12) Create branch on GIT                                                         ||  git checkout -b new-branch (to create new branch) | git branch (to see all branches)
13) To Switch to a branch or cancel creating a new one                           ||  git switch -  | git switch -master | git switch -new-branch
14) Push the branch to GitHub                                                    ||  git push origin new-branch
15) Pull changes from GitHub that you don't have on your computer                ||  git pull origin master
16) To See all previous changes saved                                            ||  git log
17) Travel back to old commit                                                    ||  git checkout <hashvalue of commit>
18) To track status of changes                                                   ||  git status
