<head>New HTML Page to see Git Commands</head>
<body>
    Adding a new HTML Page from VS Code to see if this gets pushed to GitHub and see 
    if VS Code pickups that this file is untracked or modified or not.

    Need to push this to GitHUb as soon as I am done editing

    Hope there are no issues with that.
    Adding another line from Github.com website to see if changes are being tracked to the local repo or not/.
